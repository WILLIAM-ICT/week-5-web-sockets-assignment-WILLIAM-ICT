📄 Project Description: Real-Time Chat App with Socket.io
Overview
This project is a full-stack real-time chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with Socket.io integration. It enables users to communicate in real time through group rooms and private messages. The app showcases modern web development practices, interactive UI components, and advanced Socket.io features such as typing indicators and read receipts.

🎯 Key Features
🔐 User Authentication: Secure login and session handling (can be expanded with JWT).

💬 Real-Time Messaging: Bi-directional communication using Socket.io.

🛏️ Chat Rooms: Join public or private chat rooms dynamically.

✍️ Typing Indicator: See when other users are typing.

✅ Read Receipts: Know when your messages are read.

🟢 User Presence: Real-time tracking of online users (optional extension).

📱 Responsive UI: Built with React, easily extendable to mobile.

The user joins a room via the frontend UI.

The user interface updates in real time without reloading the page.
